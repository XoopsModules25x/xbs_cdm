<H1>Code Data Management module help</H1>

<P><span style="font-style: italic;">(c) 2004-2005 Ashley Kitson, UK. This document and associated
    program works are licensed under the GNU General Public License

</P>

<P>The Code Data Management module (or CDM) is a building block
    module that is aimed at assisting Xoops business systems developers.
</P>

<P>This is the help file. For Class and Function definitions see <A HREF="../docs/CDM/cdm.html" TARGET="_blank">CDM Class Documentation</A></P>

<H3>Background</H3>

<P>Most business systems (and many non-business ones) rely on codes
    to codify data in their databases. You can think of common ones such
    as country codes, currency codes etc. This is such a common task that
    a way of handling all code requirements within a set of applications
    that make up a business system is seen as desirable and efficient. In
    large organisations a function of IT may be to maintain a core set of
    codes used by the rest of the organisation so that strict integrity
    can be maintained between different applications. It does not make
    sense for two applications wanting to use currency codes for instance
    to use two different sets which may or may not be the same sets.
</P>

<P>Thus CDM was borne, primarily as a building block for the author's
    own application building project, but also as a way to give a bit
    back to the Xoops community. As it was the author's first Xoops
    application it was good way to learn the Xoops API and the code has
    been liberally sprinkled with comments to assist any other would be
    Xoops programmers in what at first can seem (and was!) a daunting
    task.
</P>

<H3>What does it do?</H3>

<P>CDM provides the following functionality;
</P>
<UL>
    <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Provides a central repository for
        all codes that may be used in one or more Xoops applications
    </P>
    <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Provides central management of
        code data utilising Xoops group authority mechanisms
    </P>
    <LI><P>Provides a program API based on xoopsObject that can easily
        extended for additional application functionality
    </P>
</UL>
<H3>Change log</H3>

<P>V1.0 Basic release<BR>V1.1 Added cd_param field to cdm_code to add
    user defineable parameters for a code<BR>V1.2 Added ability to bulk
    upload data from SQL insert statement file<BR>V1.3 Added full support
    for hierarchical code sets<BR>V1.4 Maintenance release<BR>V1.5 Moved
    all admin things to admin backend. Added code lookup block. Added
    html code list selector data caching<BR>to speed up display of html
    selector boxes via FormCountry etc.</P>

<P><span style="font-weight: bold;">V1.5 will be the last full release for Xoops V2.0.x All future
    development will be for Xoops 2.2.x</span></P>

<H3>Installing CDM</H3>

<P>Installing CDM is as straightforward as installing any other Xoops
    module. Simply unpack the archive file into a directory called
    'xbscdm' in your Xoops module directory. Then install as for any
    other module using the Xoops administration-modules functionality.
    The installation process loads 4 default sets of codes 1/BASE - just
    a holder for application base data, 2/LANGUAGE - the set of allowable
    languages that codes can be recorded under, 3/ CURRENCY - set of ISO
    currency codes, 4/ COUNTRY - set of ISO country codes.
</P>

<P>By default the module is available to the administrator and
    registered users group. You can of course give access to other groups
    if required.
</P>

<H3>Concepts</H3>

<P>It is important to understand a few concepts about CDM before
    beginning to use it.
</P>

<P><span style="font-style: italic;">What constitutes a code set?</span> Each code set is made up from
    2 entities, the meta data about the code set and the code set
    itself;<BR>The meta data describes the name and purpose of the code
    set. It also defines the data type and length of the code and the
    code value. Meta data is held in the cdm_meta table which is defined
    as:<BR>&nbsp;cdm_meta (<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_set varchar(10) NOT NULL
    default 'BASE',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_type
    enum('INTEGER','BIGINT','CHAR','VARCHAR') NOT NULL default
    'CHAR',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_len int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default
    '0',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;val_type
    enum('INTEGER','BIGINT','CHAR','VARCHAR') NOT NULL default
    'VARCHAR',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;val_len int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default
    '255',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_desc varchar(255) default NULL,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;row_flag
    enum('Active','Defunct','Suspended') default 'Active',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;row_uid
    int(10) unsigned default '0',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;row_dt timestamp(6) NOT
    NULL,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIMARY KEY (cd_set))
</P>

<P>The code set contains an entry for each code that makes up a code
    set. Most importantly however, a code set can contain multiple
    entries for a code distinguished by different languages. This allows
    multi lingual code sets to be presented to the user where the code
    itslef remains the same but the value displayed to the user is in
    different languages. Code data is held in the cdm_code table which is
    defined as:<BR>&nbsp;cdm_code (<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;id bigint(20) NOT NULL
    auto_increment,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_set varchar(10) NOT NULL default
    '',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_lang varchar(10) NOT NULL default 'EN',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd
    varchar(10) NOT NULL default '',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_prnt varchar(10)
    default NULL,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_value varchar(50) default
    NULL,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_desc varchar(255) default NULL,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd_param
    varchar(255) default NULL,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;row_flag
    enum('Active','Defunct','Suspended') NOT NULL default
    'Active',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;row_uid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default
    '0',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;row_dt timestamp(6) NOT NULL,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIMARY
    KEY (id),<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;UNIQUE KEY cdm_code_main_index
    (cd_set,cd_lang,cd),<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;KEY cdm_code_FKIndex1 (cd_set))
</P>

<P>Note that although the primary key is an auto-incrementing integer
    for efficiency, the real index to the data is on SetName, Language
    and Code name.
</P>

<P><span style="font-style: italic;">Data is never deleted.</span> In the CDM admin interface discussed
    later, when you select a set or code to delete, it is not in fact
    deleted. It is &quot;defuncted&quot;, (made unuseable.) This (within
    the interface given anyway) is an irreversable process. Once defunct,
    always defunct. Similarly if you defunct a set, then all its
    associated codes are made defunct. The only way to reverse this is to
    use a manual SQL command (perhaps via phpMyAdmin.) By default new
    codes and sets are flagged as active. You can set them as Suspended.
    If Suspended they may be made active again. Why go to all this
    trouble? In the real world there will be times when you do need to
    take a code out of action temporarily, hence suspension. There are
    also times when a code goes out of action permanently. If we simply
    delete it, then any application data that relies on the code for
    meaning becomes meaningless. Thus we defunct it ensuring that any
    relationship to the code data is maintained, but at the same time
    making sure we cannot use the code again in future. All of the main
    program API functions will only return code data that is 'Active'.
    Thus if you stick to the public API you should never have invalid
    code information.
</P>

<P>In addition to recording the code or set status, the system also
    records the name of the last user to edit data and the date and time.
    This can be used for auditing purposes.
</P>

<H3>Using CDM</H3>
<H4><A NAME="DDE_LINK1"></A>Interactive Use - Client side – Main
    module screen</H4>

<P>Go to your site main page and click on the 'Code Data Management'
    menu item. the screen will display 2 sets of information. In the top
    table you will see the list of available code sets. In the bottom
    table you will see all the codes for the currently selected code set.
</P>

<P>Hopefully the screens are easy enough to navigate. Click the
    Browse icon next to a code set to see the codes associated with it.
</P>

<P>A sub-menu item gives access to the complete list of codes.</P>

<P>If you don't want the main module to display to the main user
    menu, simply set the order to 0 (zero) in the administration-modules
    screen. Alternatively, limit access using the group permission
    facilities as usual.</P>
<H4>Interactive Use - Client side – Code lookup block</H4>

<P>CDM is provided with a block that allows users to lookup a code
    description and retrieve its code value. As with all Xoops blocks
    this is controlled via the administration-blocks screen. Editing the
    blocks details allows you to set the initial code set and language
    set for display in the block. You can also allow the user to change
    the code set they can see and the language set interactively in the
    block. These two features are off by default.</P>
<H4>Interactive use - Admin side</H4>

<P>In common with most Xoops modules, CDM has an administration
    interface for the module. This is where most of the work is done with
    CDM as it is really a backend module. Click on the CDM logo in the
    Xoops admin menu. You will be presented with a Xoops 2.2 style menu
    (for Xoops 2.0.x users, this is what Xoops 2.2.x admin menus will
    generally look like.)</P>

<P>At the top of the screen you have a mini menu to select;</P>
<UL>
    <P>- Module Config<BR>- Module Home Page<BR>- Module Documentation<BR>-
        Module Support</P>
</UL>
<P>Module config leads to a normal Xoops style preferences page where
    you can change a few parameters notably<BR>- CDM path. Change this if
    you install CDM into anything other than the default path (relative
    to xoops/module/)<BR>- Default language. Change this if you want
    codes delivered by default in any language other than English Base
    (EN)<BR>- Default Code Set. Change this to display something other
    than BASE when you click the CDM menu option on the user side.</P>

<P>Module Home Page simulates clicking on Code Data Management from
    the user menu.</P>

<P>Module Documentation will open another browser window and display
    this help document. You can access the API Class definition
    documentation from this page, (as long as you access this page from
    the administration menu.)</P>

<P>Module Support will open another browser window at the support
    home for CDM.</P>

<P>Below the mini menu, you will see a 'tabbed' menu. This gives you
    the opportunity to;</P>
<UL>
    <P>- Change Code Set details (Code Sets)<BR>- Change Code details
        (Codes)<BR>- Upload code set data to CDM (Bulk Upload)</P>
</UL>
<H5>Code Sets – Adding/editing code set meta data</H5>

<P>Click this menu tab to edit code set meta data. Choose a set to
    edit or click the insert button to create a new code set. The screen
    will display a form for your chosen set (blank fields for a new set).
    Here you describe the code set. Enter a name for the set (the
    convention is upper case for set name.) Describe the code data type
    and length and its display value and length. Enter also a description
    for the code set. If you change the row status flag, it will change
    all dependent codes to the same value. Remember, if you set it as
    'Defunct' you cannot later change it back. Click Submit to save your
    changes.</P>
<H5>Codes – Adding/editing a code in a set</H5>

<P>Click this menu tab to edit a code in a set. When you first click
    this you will see a form asking you to select a code set and a
    language to edit. Select the relevant one and you will be presented
    with a list of available codes for the code-set/language combination.
    The onscreen descriptions for the fields should be self explanatory
    but if not, ping a message on the support forum and I'll do my best
    to answer queries.</P>

<P><span style="font-style: italic;">About the code parameter field</span>. This is essentially a user
    defineable field and was added at V1.1 to satisfy user requirements
    to be able to hold characteristic data or parameters for a code. E.g.
    a code set for shapes what want to have additional data describing
    the shape i.e. No of sides, colour, size; therefore code parameters
    might be set as 4|Red|Big or sides=4,colour=red,size=big. The choice
    of parameters and how you seperate them is up to you. I do recommend
    however that you use the pipe &quot;|&quot; character as a seperator
    for consistency. Be aware however that you can only decide the rules
    for a codeset if you originate it. If for instance you want to change
    the inbuilt country set you can only really do so for yourself as the
    originator (in this case me) may not wish to have that set of
    parameters (although in my case, I'm open to suggestion!) You are
    limited to a total of 255 characters in the parameter field.
</P>

<P><span style="font-style: italic;">About hierarchical code sets.</span> You can construct code sets
    that have a tree hierarchy simply by adding the code for the parent
    to each child code. When you display the edit screen for the parent
    code, its child codes are displayed on the screen and you can
    hyperlink through to the children. Support is given in the Set
    object to create a xoopsTree object of hierarchical code sets that
    can then be used by your application.
</P>
<H5>Bulk Upload - adding bulk data to CDM</H5>

<P>Although you can add a set and codes manually, there will be times
    when you want to mass add codes in one hit. Use the bulk upload
    facility in CDM for this. You will need to provide a valid SQL syntax
    file donating the data insert commands for this. Take a look at
    test.sql in the cdm sql directory for an example file.
</P>

<P>*Very* important. You need to have as your first line :<BR>set
    @lang = '&lt;a language code&gt;';</P>

<P>whether or not you intend to use it as shown in the test.sql
    example file. This allows data set authors to create a single upload
    file for similar languages. The most common of these is probably ENGB
    and ENUS. If the statement is not present as the first line, the
    upload file will not generate entries in the database. If you need to
    change the language set from its default, make sure it conforms to
    one that is in the default system language code set.
</P>

<P>Please note that for Xoops to accept .sql files for upload and
    processing you will need to amend your xoops/class/mimetypes.inc.php
    to contain an entry for .sql files;<BR>&quot;sql&quot; =&gt;
    &quot;text/plain&quot;,
</P>

<P>If you are not comfortable doing this, simply use a .txt extension
    for your sql files. Xoops will accept these happily.
</P>

<P>Please note that the sql command interpreter will accept most
    valid SQL including deletes. You cannot however use core XOOPS tables
    in your commands. One other thing, you need to have your Xoops/upload
    directory set to be world writeable. By default this should be the
    case anyway, but if you do get problems, check this first.
</P>

<P>If you want to run the &quot;test.sql&quot; file to try it out,
    you can run the &quot;delete_test_data.sql&quot; file after to remove
    the test data from the database. The bulk update facility may also be
    used by the system authors to apply patches to CDM installation prior
    to V2.2 of Xoops.
</P>
<H4>The API</H4>

<P>The real utility of CDM comes when you incorporate it into your
    own module. You need to do a few simple things to access CDM.
</P>

<P>1/ In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">header.php</span> script of your own module add the
    following line after your include to mainfile.php;
</P>

<P>require XOOPS_ROOT_PATH.&quot;/modules/cdm/include/defines.php&quot;;
</P>

<P>2/ If you want to use the built in xoopsForm extensions for
    CURRENCY, COUNTRY, LANGUAGE and ROW_STATUS in a form generation page
    include the following line somewhere at the head of your script;
</P>

<P>require_once CDM_PATH.&quot;/class/class.cdm.form.php&quot;;
</P>

<P>By far and away the easiest way to use CDM is by extending the
    FormSelect object found in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">class.cdm.form.php</span> script.
    Take a look at that script to see how the FormSelectCountry and
    other code select list objects are instantiated and use them as a
    model to create your own class.
</P>

<P>NB. Under normal circumstances you should write any extensions to
    the CDM classes within your own code base. This ensures that any
    updates to CDM in the future will not require you to patch the code.
    The following might act as a template for a class that you create for
    your own application (in this example for a code set called 'CARDS';
</P>

<P><span style="font-style: italic;">filename=class.mymodule.form.php</span><BR><BR>&nbsp;require_once
    CDM_PATH.&quot;/class/class.cdm.form.php&quot;;
</P>

<P>&nbsp;class MyModuleFormSelectCards extends FormSelect
    {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;function MyModuleFormSelectCards($caption, $name,
    $value=null, $size=1, $lang=CDM_DEF_LANG)
    {<BR>$this-&gt;FormSelect('CARDS', $caption, $name, $value, $size,
    $lang);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<BR>&nbsp;}</P>

<P>In your form creation script your would include or require
    class.mymodule.form.php and create a new Select box with something
    like;<BR>$cards = new MyModuleFormSelectCards('Select a
    card','card');
</P>

<P>Take a look at the scripts <span style="font-weight: bold;">cdm_codes_edit.php</span> and
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">cdm_meta_edit.php</span> to see the built in Forms objects being
    used. (You can find these in the 'deprecated' directory under the CDM
    module directory, as they are no longer used as at V1.5)</P>

<P>All of the CDM Form Select boxes make use of the inbuilt code set
    caching capability. This creates an array for translating into an
    html selection box when any particular selection box is first used
    (by any user) and stores it away in the database (cdm_list table.)
    On subsequent calls to create the selection box, the preformed list
    is extracted and displayed. This greatly speeds up page display on
    all but the first call to the selection box class. When you use the
    admin facilities (or use the proper class methods) to insert a new
    code into the database, the list for the code set are cleared, to be
    recreated with new data on subsequent calls to the selection box
    objects.</P>

<P>If you want to do something more complex with your code data then
    you will need to use the Meta, Code and Set objects with
    their associated handlers directly. The class tree for these objects
    is:
</P>

<P>XoopsObject<BR>---&gt; BaseObject<BR>--------&gt;
    Meta<BR>--------&gt; Code<BR>--------&gt; Set</P>

<P>XoopsObjectHandler<BR>---&gt; BaseHandler<BR>--------&gt;
    CdmCDMMetaHandler<BR>--------&gt; CdmCDMCodeHandler<BR>--------&gt;
    CdmCDMSetHandler</P>

<P>To use these objects you create a handler object and then ask it
    to create or get the data object e.g.;
</P>

<P>//NB CDM_DIR is a constant set in defines.php and must be used in
    calls to xoops_getModuleHandler<BR>$setHandler =&amp;
    xoops_getModuleHandler(&quot;Set&quot;,CDM_DIR);<BR>$set =&amp;
    $setHandler-&gt;get(&quot;SOMESET&quot;);<BR>$set2 =&amp;
    $setHandler-&gt;create();
</P>

<P>There are a few utility functions that you can use in your code as
    well. Include the include/functions.php file to access them.
    Functions are:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>function CDMGetCode($codeSet, $codeKey,
    $lang=CDM_DEF_LANG)<BR>Returns a the code value for a given set and
    code key.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>function CDMGetParams($codeSet, $codeKey,
    $lang=CDM_DEF_LANG)<BR>Returns a the parameters for a given set and
    code key. (Tip - use PHP explode function to seperate the paramater
    string into an indexed array.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>function CDMCheckCode($codeSet, $codeKey, $value,
    $lang=CDM_DEF_LANG)<BR>Checks a code for a given value and returns
    TRUE if correct else FALSE.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>function CDMGetCodeSet($codeSet,
    $lang=CDM_DEF_LANG)<BR>Returns CDMCodeSet object for the given
    codeset identifer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>function CDMGetCodeObj($codeSet, $codeKey,
    $lang=CDM_DEF_LANG)<BR>Returns a Code object for the requested
    code in a set.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>function getXoopsUser($id)<BR>Return a valid xoops user
    name given the user id
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Check out the <A HREF="../docs/CDM/cdm.html" TARGET="_blank">CDM Class Documentation</A> for further details
</P>

<P>Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold;">index.php, cdm_codes_edit.php </span>and
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">cdm_meta_edit.php</span> for more examples. You will also need to
    study <span style="font-weight: bold;">class.cdm.base.php, Meta.php, Code.php </span>and
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Set.php</span> for class definitions. Beware however that under
    normal circumstances, you should avoid using the &quot;getall&quot;
    methods of the handler objects as they will return all data
    (suspended and defunct) which is not usually what you require. Use
    the &quot;get&quot; method.
</P>
